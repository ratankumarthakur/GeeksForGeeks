You are given an undirected graph of N nodes (numbered from 0 to N-1) and M edges. Return 1 if the graph is a tree, else return 0.

Note: The input graph can have self-loops and multiple edges.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4, M = 3
G = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]]
Output: 
1
Explanation: 
Every node is reachable and the graph has no loops, so it is a tree
Example 2:

Input:
N = 4, M = 3
G = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0]]
Output: 
0
Explanation: 
3 is not connected to any node and there is a loop 0->1->2->0, so it is not a tree.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isTree() which takes the integer N (the number nodes in the input graph) and the edges representing the graph as input parameters and returns 1 if the input graph is a tree, else 0.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N+M)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 2*105
0 <= M <= 2*105
