Given a connected undirected graph with n nodes and m edges, with each node having a distinct label from 0 to n-1, create a clone of the graph. Each node in the graph contains an integer val and an array (neighbors) of nodes, containing nodes that are adjacent to the current node.

Note: If the user returns a correct copy of the given graph, then the system will print 1; in the case when an incorrect copy is generated or when the user returns the original node, the system will print 0.

For Example :    

class Node {
    val: integer
    neighbors: List[Node]
}
Example 1:

Input:
adjList = 
{
    {1, 3},
    {0, 2},
    {1, 3},
    {0, 2}
}
Output: 1
Explanation:
1 is the output that the driver code will print in case 
you successfully cloned the given graph.
Example 2:

Input:
adjList = 
{
    {1},
    {0}
}
Output: 1
Explanation: 
1 is the output that the driver code will print in case
you successfully cloned the given graph.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function cloneGraph( ) which takes a node will always be the first node of the graph as input and returns the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n + m).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n).

Constraints:
1 <= n, m <= 104
1 <= Node value <= n
